// Given ‘N’ ropes with different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one big rope with minimum cost. 
// The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths.

// Solution
const Heap = require('./collections/heap'); //http://www.collectionsjs.com

function minimum_cost_to_connect_ropes(ropeLengths) {
  // add all ropes to the min heap
  const minHeap = new Heap(ropeLengths, null, ((a, b) => b - a));

  // go through the values of the heap, in each step take top (i.e., lowest) rope lengths from the min heap
  // connect them and push the result back to the min heap.
  // keep doing this until the heap is left with only one rope
  let result = 0;

  while (minHeap.length > 1) {
    const temp = minHeap.pop() + minHeap.pop();
    result += temp;
    minHeap.push(temp);
  }

  return result;
}
